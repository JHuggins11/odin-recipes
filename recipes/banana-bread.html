        <h2 class="recipe-heading">Description</h2>
        <p>
            An easy-to-make recipe for a delicious loaf of banana bread, particularly great if you have overripe bananas - these can be used
            rather than being thrown away.
        </p>

        <h2 class="recipe-heading">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>140g softened butter</li>
            <li>140g caster sugar</li>
            <li>2 beaten large eggs</li>
            <li>140g self-raising flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>2 mashed very ripe bananas</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="recipe-heading">Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat your oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.</li>
            <li>Grease a 2lb loaf baking tin and line it with baking parchment.</li>
            <li>Take the softened butter and caster sugar, creaming them until they're light and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the beaten eggs and a little bit of the self-raising flour to the butter and sugar mixture.</li>
            <li>Fold in the flour left back, baking powder and mashed bananas.</li>
            <li>
                Pour the mixture into the baking tin, place the tins into the oven and bake for approx. 50 mins or until cooked through. 
                Check the loaf every 5 mins after approx. 30-40 mins in the oven with a skewer test, where the skewer should go through
                the loaf cleanly. 
            </li>
            <li>Cool in the tin for 10 mins. After that, take out the loaf and place on a wire rack.</li>
        </ol>
