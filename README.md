# odin-recipes
This is a simple recipe website project that I have made as part of the HTML section in The Odin Project's (https://www.theodinproject.com) Foundations course.
It will consist of an index page with relative links to other pages featuring different recipes. 

Here, I test my skills at basic HTML including appropriate headings, titles, style tags (e.g. <strong>, <em>), images and links.
At the moment, the website looks very basic, but once I go through more of the material on The Odin Project where I am introduced to CSS, I will return to this
project to improve its appearance with CSS.
